<h1>Center for New Testament Restoration<br>King James Textus Receptus Greek New Testament</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The 2014 King James Textus Receptus (KJTR) text was created by Alan Bunning for the Center for New Testament Restoration to reconstruct the Greek text matching the English of the various so-called “1769 editions” of the King James Bible commonly used today. Most King James Bibles today do not follow either of the 1611 editions, nor do they follow the 1769 Cambridge or 1769 Oxford editions as they have undergone further editing. The KJTR text is more accurate than the 1884 Scrivener text (which also sought to reconstruct the Greek text underlying the King James Bible but deviated from it in a number of places). By happenstance, the KJTR text also matches the text of the 2006 Pure Cambridge Edition, which merely borrowed readings from these various “1769 editions”.
